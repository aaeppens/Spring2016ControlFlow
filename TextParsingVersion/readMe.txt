The best (easiest) way I know to make this program run is by opening the project1.sln file from visual studio (I was using 2016). The program requires a .txt binary input that is in the fashion of the files located in the 'input files' directory. 

If some brave sole is attempting to use this code in the furure and has any questions please feel free to email me at aaeppens@gmail.com
